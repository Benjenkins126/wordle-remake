# Introduction
This is a project I made that's a re-creation of the game Wordle. It is built in JavaScript so the entire thing can be run locally if you want to play offline.

# How to play
1. You have 7 tries to guess the 6 character long word (Guesses must be a valid word)
2. On each guess the squares will either highlight gray, orange or green. (Gray = Character is not in the final word) (Orange = Character is in the final word, but not in the place that you specified) (Green = Character is correct, and in the correct place)
3. If you guess the final word within 7 tries, you win! However, if you fail to guess the full word you're out
4. The aim of the game is to get it in as least tries as possible

# How to install
Simply download the files, and open index.html in a browser.
